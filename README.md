Project Introduction: AI Companies Analysis Using Power BI

In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the "AI Companies" dataset using Power BI to gain valuable insights into the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence industry. The dataset includes crucial information such as company names, descriptions, headquarters, founding years, annual revenues, and Glassdoor scores.

The primary objective of this project was to visualize and analyze data trends related to AI companies, focusing on aspects such as geographic distribution, revenue patterns, company performance ratings, and industry growth. Power BI's robust visualization tools allowed us to create dynamic dashboards, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and identify potential opportunities within the AI sector.

This analysis not only highlights key players in the industry but also provides a strategic overview of market trends, contributing to better understanding and forecasting of the AI landscape.
